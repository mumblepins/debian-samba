Template: samba/run_mode
Type: select
Default: daemons
Choices: daemons, inetd
Description: How do you want to run Samba?
 The Samba services (nmbd and smbd) can run as normal daemons or 
 from inetd. Running as daemons is the recommended approach.

Template: samba/generate_smbpasswd
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Create samba password file, /etc/samba/smbpasswd?
 To be compatible with the defaults in most versions of Windows,
 Samba must be configured to use encrypted passwords.  This requires
 user passwords to be stored in a file separate from /etc/passwd.
 This file can be created automatically, but the passwords must
 be added manually (by you or the user) by running smbpasswd,
 and you must arrange to keep it up-to-date in the future.  If
 you do not create it, you will have to reconfigure samba
 (and probably your client machines) to use plaintext passwords.
 See /usr/share/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/ENCRYPTION.html from the 
 samba-doc package for more details.

Template: samba/log_files_moved
Type: note
Description: Samba's log files have moved.
 Starting with the first packages of Samba 2.2 for Debian the log
 files for both Samba daemons (nmbd and smbd) are now stored in
 /var/log/samba/. The names of the files are log.nmbd and log.smbd,
 for nmbd and smbd respectively.
 .
 The old log files that were in /var/log/ will be moved to
 the new location for you.

Template: samba/tdbsam
Type: note
Description: /etc/samba/smbpasswd is no longer used
 Beginning with Samba 2.2.5-3, /etc/samba/smbpasswd is deprecated in
 favor of the new, more feature-rich tdbsam backend.  Your existing
 smbpasswd entries will be converted for you, and all of the Samba
 tools, including /usr/bin/smbpasswd, will seamlessly integrate with the
 new system; however, you will no longer be able to edit
 /etc/samba/smbpasswd directly to make changes to your SAM database.
