Template: samba/generate_smbpasswd
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Create samba password database, /var/lib/samba/passdb.tdb?
 To be compatible with the defaults in most versions of Windows, Samba must
 be configured to use encrypted passwords.  This requires user passwords to
 be stored in a file separate from /etc/passwd.  This file can be created
 automatically, but the passwords must be added manually by running
 smbpasswd and be kept up-to-date in the future.
 .
 If you do not create it, you will have to reconfigure Samba (and probably
 your client machines) to use plaintext passwords.
 .
 See /usr/share/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/ENCRYPTION.html from the
 samba-doc package for more details.

Template: samba/run_mode
Type: select
_Choices: daemons, inetd
Default: daemons
_Description: How do you want to run Samba?
 The Samba daemon smbd can run as a normal daemon or from inetd. Running as
 a daemon is the recommended approach.

Template: samba/tdbsam
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Move /etc/samba/smbpasswd to /var/lib/samba/passdb.tdb?
 Samba 3.0 introduced a more complete SAM database interface which
 supersedes the /etc/samba/smbpasswd file.
 .
 Please confirm whether you would like the existing smbpasswd file to
 be automatically migrated to /var/lib/samba/passdb.tdb.  Do not
 choose this option if you plan to use another pdb backend (e.g.,
 LDAP) instead.
