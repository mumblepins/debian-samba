Note about upgrading from older versions:
-----------------------------------------

It is still the case that there are printing tdbs (ntprinting.tdb, ntforms.tdb,
ntdrivers.tdb) which are in latin1 or other encodings. When updating from
Samba 3.5 or earlier to Samba 3.6 or 4.0 these tdbs need to be migrated to our
new registry based printing management.  This means during the migration we
also need to do charset conversion. This can only been done manually cause we don't
know in which encoding the tdb is. You have to specify the correct code page
for the conversion, see iconv -l and Wikipedia [1] for the available codepages.
The mostly used one is Windows Latin1 which is CP1252.

We've extended the 'net printing dump' and 'net printing migrate' commands to
define the encoding of the tdb. So you can correctly view the tdb with:

  net printing dump encoding=CP1252 /path/to/ntprinters.tdb

or migrate it with e.g.:

  net printing migrate encoding=CP1252 /path/to/ntprinters.tdb

If you migrate printers we suggest you do it in the following order.

ntforms.tdb
ntdrivers.tdb
ntprinting.tdb

Don't forget to rename, move or delete these files in /var/lib/samba after the
migration.

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.0.2
                         January 30, 2013
                   =============================


This is a security release in order to address
CVE-2013-0213 (Clickjacking issue in SWAT) and
CVE-2013-0214 (Potential XSRF in SWAT).

o  CVE-2013-0213:
   All current released versions of Samba are vulnerable to clickjacking in the
   Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT). When the SWAT pages are integrated into
   a malicious web page via a frame or iframe and then overlaid by other content,
   an attacker could trick an administrator to potentially change Samba settings.

   In order to be vulnerable, SWAT must have been installed and enabled
   either as a standalone server launched from inetd or xinetd, or as a
   CGI plugin to Apache. If SWAT has not been installed or enabled (which
   is the default install state for Samba) this advisory can be ignored.

o  CVE-2013-0214:
   All current released versions of Samba are vulnerable to a cross-site
   request forgery in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT). By guessing a
   user's password and then tricking a user who is authenticated with SWAT into
   clicking a manipulated URL on a different web page, it is possible to manipulate
   SWAT.

   In order to be vulnerable, the attacker needs to know the victim's password.
   Additionally SWAT must have been installed and enabled either as a standalone
   server launched from inetd or xinetd, or as a CGI plugin to Apache. If SWAT has
   not been installed or enabled (which is the default install state for Samba)
   this advisory can be ignored.


Changes since 4.0.1:

                   Release Notes for Samba 4.0.1
                          January 15, 2013
                   =============================


This is a security release in order to address CVE-2013-0172.

o  CVE-2013-0172:
   Samba 4.0.0 as an AD DC may provide authenticated users with write access
   to LDAP directory objects.

   In AD, Access Control Entries can be assigned based on the objectClass
   of the object.  If a user or a group the user is a member of has any
   access based on the objectClass, then that user has write access to that
   object.

   Additionally, if a user has write access to any attribute on the object,
   they may have access to write to all attributes.

   An important mitigation is that anonymous access is totally disabled by
   default.  The second important mitigation is that normal users are
   typically only given the problematic per-objectClass right via the
   "pre-windows 2000 compatible access" group, and Samba 4.0.0 incorrectly
   does not make "authenticated users" part of this group.

Changes since 4.0.0:
====================

o   Andrew Bartlett <abartlet@samba.org>
    * Bug 9554 - CVE-2013-0172 - Samba 4.0 as an AD DC may provide authenticated
      users with write access to LDAP directory objects.

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.0.0
                         December 11, 2012
                   =============================


This is is the first stable release of Samba 4.0.

This release contains the best of all of Samba's
technology parts, both a file server (that you can reasonably expect
to upgrade existing Samba 3.x releases to) and the AD domain
controller work previously known as 'Samba4'.

Major enhancements in Samba 4.0.0 include:

Active Directory services
=========================

Samba 4.0 supports the server-side of the Active Directory logon
environment used by Windows 2000 and later, so we can do full domain
join and domain logon operations with these clients.

Our Domain Controller (DC) implementation includes our own built-in
LDAP server and Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) as well as the
Samba3-like logon services provided over CIFS.  We correctly generate
the infamous Kerberos PAC, and include it with the Kerberos tickets we
issue.

When running an AD DC, you only need to run 'samba' (not smbd/nmbd/winbindd),
as the required services are co-coordinated by this master binary.
The tool to administer the Active Directory services is called 'samba-tool'.

A short guide to setting up Samba 4 as an AD DC can be found on the wiki:

  http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/HOWTO


File Services
=============

Samba 4.0.0 ships with two distinct file servers.  We now use the
file server from the Samba 3.x series 'smbd' for all file serving by
default.

Samba 4.0 also ships with the 'NTVFS' file server.  This file server
is what was used prior to the beta2 release of Samba 4.0, and is
tuned to match the requirements of an AD domain controller.  We
continue to support this, not only to provide continuity to
installations that have deployed it as part of an AD DC, but also as a
running example of the NT-FSA architecture we expect to move smbd to in
the longer term.

For pure file server work, the binaries users would expect from that
series (smbd, nmbd, winbindd, smbpasswd) continue to be available.


Domain Member Support
=====================

Domain member support in the 'samba' binary is in its infancy, and
is not comparable to the support found in 'winbindd'. As such, on
Samba domain member servers, the binaries 'smbd', 'nmbd' and 'winbindd'
are to be used, as known from Samba 3 domain member server setups.
The only exceptions from this rule are the cases which explicitly
require the 'samba' binary, namely running the ntvfs file server,
the CIFS proxy or OpenChange on a domain member.


DNS
===

As DNS is an integral part of Active Directory, we also provide two DNS
solutions, a simple internal DNS server for 'out of the box' configurations
and a more elaborate BIND plugin using the BIND DLZ mechanism in versions
9.8 and 9.9. During the provision, you can select which backend to use.
With the internal backend, your DNS server is good to go.
If you chose the BIND_DLZ backend, a configuration file will be generated
for bind to make it use this plugin, as well as a file explaining how to
set up bind.


NTP
===

To provide accurate timestamps to Windows clients, we integrate with
the NTP project to provide secured NTP replies.  To use you need to
start ntpd and configure it with the 'restrict ... ms-sntp' and
ntpsigndsocket options.


Python Scripting Interface
==========================

A new scripting interface has been added to Samba 4, allowing
Python programs to interface to Samba's internals, and many tools and
internal workings of the DC code is now implemented in python.


Known Issues
============

- Replication of DNS data from one AD server to another may not work.
  The DNS data used by the internal DNS server and bind9_dlz is stored
  in an application partition in our directory.  The replication of
  this partition is not yet reliable.

- Replication may fail on FreeBSD due to getaddrinfo() rejecting names
  containing _.  A workaround will be in a future release.

- samba_upgradeprovision should not be run when upgrading to this release
  from a recent release.  No important database format changes have
  been made since alpha16.

- Installation on systems without a system iconv (and developer
  headers at compile time) is known to cause errors when dealing with
  non-ASCII characters.

- There is no NetBIOS browsing support (network neighbourhood)
  available for the AD domain controller.  (Support in nmbd and smbd
  for classic domains and member/standalone servers is unchanged).

- Clock Synchronisation is critical.  Many 'wrong password' errors are
  actually due to Kerberos objecting to a clock skew between client
  and server.  (The NTP work in the previous alphas are partly to assist
  with this problem).

- The DRS replication code may fail.  Please contact the team if you
  experience issues with DRS replication, as we have fixed many issues
  here in response to feedback from our production users.

- Linux inotify will now only be supported on systems where glibc also supports
  it (for details, please refer to bug #8850).


Upgrading
=========

Users upgrading from Samba 3.x domain controllers and wanting to use
Samba 4.0 as an AD DC should use the 'samba-tool domain
classicupgrade' command.  See the wiki for more details:
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/samba3upgrade/HOWTO.

Users upgrading from Samba 4.0 alpha and beta releases since alpha15
should run 'samba-tool dbcheck --cross-ncs --fix' before re-starting
Samba.  Users upgrading from earlier alpha releases should contact the
team for advice.

Users upgrading an AD DC from any previous release should run
'samba-tool ntacl sysvolreset' to re-sync ACLs on the sysvol share
with those matching the GPOs in LDAP and the defaults from an initial
provision.  This will set an underlying POSIX ACL if required (eg not
using the NTVFS file server).

If you used the BIND9_FLATFILE or BIND9_DLZ features,
you'll have to add '-dns' to the 'server services' option,
as the internal dns server (SAMBA_INTERNAL) is the default now.


Supported features
==================

A whitepaper of currently (un-)supported features is available on the wiki:

CHANGES SINCE 4.0.0rc5
======================

In this release candidate, we have a significant number of improvements
to our Access Control List (ACL) code, particularly for the Active
Directory Domain Controller, but also in our general purpose file
server.

These changes are important, as they enable Group Policy Objects to work
correctly, allow administrators to impose restrictions on some users
reading certain parts of the directory and correctly propagating
inherited ACLs down the LDAP directory tree.

Users of the Active Directory Domain Controller upgrading from any
previous release should run 'samba-tool ntacl sysvolreset' to re-sync
ACLs on the sysvol share with those matching the GPOs in LDAP and the
defaults from an initial provision.  This will set an underlying POSIX
ACL if required.

The ACLs in the Active Directory are also checked on searches by default.
The automatic inheritance of ACLs is also correctly recalculated on
changes now.

CHANGES SINCE 4.0.0rc4
======================

With this release candidate the location of the socket samba accepts
connections from NTPd has changed, as has the enforced permissions.

This means the ntp.conf will need to change from (eg)

ntpsigndsocket /usr/local/samba/var/run/ntp_signd/

to

ntpsigndsocket /usr/local/samba/var/lib/ntp_signd/

To use the socket with ntp on a system with an ntp user and group, you must
run:

chgrp ntp /usr/local/samba/var/lib/ntp_signd/
