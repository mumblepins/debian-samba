                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 3.6.0
                          August 9, 2011
                   =============================


This is the first release of Samba 3.6.0.

Major enhancements in Samba 3.6.0 include:


Changed security defaults
-------------------------

Samba 3.6 has adopted a number of improved security defaults that will
impact on existing users of Samba.

 client ntlmv2 auth = yes
 client use spnego principal = no
 send spnego principal = no

The impact of 'client ntlmv2 auth = yes' is that by default we will not
use NTLM authentication as a client.  This applies to the Samba client
tools such as smbclient and winbind, but does not change the separately
released in-kernel CIFS client.  To re-enable the poorer NTLM encryption
set '--option=clientusentlmv2auth=no' on your smbclient command line, or
set 'client ntlmv2 auth = no' in your smb.conf

The impact of 'client use spnego principal = no' is that Samba will
use CIFS/hostname to obtain a kerberos ticket, acting more like
Windows when using Kerberos against a CIFS server in smbclient,
winbind and other Samba client tools.  This will change which servers
we will successfully negotiate kerberos connections to.  This is due
to Samba no longer trusting a server-provided hint which is not
available from Windows 2008 or later.  For correct operation with all
clients, all aliases for a server should be recorded as a as a
servicePrincipalName on the server's record in AD.  (For this reason,
this behavior change and parameter was also made in Samba 3.5.9)

The impact of 'send spnego principal = no' is to match Windows 2008 and
not to send this principal, making existing clients give more consistent
behaviour (more likely to fall back to NTLMSSP) between Samba and
Windows 2008, and between Windows versions that did and no longer use
this insecure hint.


SMB2 support
------------

SMB2 support in 3.6.0 is fully functional (with one omission),
and can be enabled by setting:

max protocol = SMB2

in the [global] section of your smb.conf and re-starting
Samba. All features should work over SMB2 except the modification
of user quotas using the Windows quota management tools.

As this is the first release containing what we consider
to be a fully featured SMB2 protocol, we are not enabling
this by default, but encourage users to enable SMB2 and
test it. Once we have enough confirmation from Samba
users and OEMs that SMB2 support is stable in wide user
testing we will enable SMB2 by default in a future Samba
release.


Internal Winbind passdb changes
-------------------------------

Winbind has been changed to use the internal samr and lsa rpc pipe to get
local user and group information instead of calling passdb functions. The
reason is to use more of our infrastructure and test this infrastructure by
using it. With this approach more code in Winbind is shared.


New Spoolss code
----------------

The spoolss and the old RAP printing code have been completely
overhauled and refactored.

All calls from lanman/printing code has been changed to go through the
spoolss RPC interfaces, this allows us to keep all checks in one place
and avoid special cases in the main printing code.
Printing code has been therefore confined within the spoolss code.

All the printing code, including the spoolss RPC interfaces has been
changed to use the winreg RPC interfaces to store all data.
All data has been migrated from custom, arbitrary TDB files to the
registry interface. This transition allow us to present correct data to
windows client accessing the server registry through the winreg RPC
interfaces to query for printer data. Data is served out from a real
registry implementation and therefore arguably 100% forward compatible.

Migration code from the previous TDB files formats is provided. This
code is automatically invoked the first time the new code is run on the
server. Although manual migration is also available using the 'net
printer migrate' command.

These changes not only make all the spoolss code much more closer to
"the spec", it also greatly improves our internal testing of both
spoolss and winreg interfaces, and reduces overall code duplication.

As part of this work, new tests have been also added to increase
coverage.

This code will also allow, in future, an easy transition to split out
the spooling functions into a separate daemon for those OEMs that do not
need printing functionality in their appliances, reducing the code
footprint.


ID Mapping Changes
------------------

The id mapping configuration has been a source of much grief in the past.
For this release, id mapping has been rewritten yet again with the goal
of making the configuration more simple and more coherent while keeping
the needed flexibility and even adding to the flexibility in some respects.

The major change that implies the configuration simplifications is at
the heart of the id mapping system: The separation of the "idmap alloc
system" that is responsible for the unix id counters in the tdb, tdb2
and ldap idmap backends from the id mapping code itself has been removed.
The sids_to_unixids operation is now atomic and encapsulates (if needed)
the action of allocating a unix id for a mapping that is to be created.
Consequently all idmap alloc configuration parameters have vanished and
it is hence now also not possible any more to specify an idmap alloc
backend different from the idmap backend. Each idmap backend uses its
own idmap unixid creation mechanism transparently.

As a consequence of the id mapping changes, the methods that are used
for storing and deleting id mappings have been removed from the winbindd
API. The "net idmap dump/restore" commands have been rewritten to
not speak through winbindd any more but directly act on the databases.
This is currently available for the tdb and tdb2 backends, the implementation
for ldap still missing.

The allocate_id functionality is preserved for the unix id creator of the
default idmap configuration is also used as the source of unix ids
for the group mapping database and for the posix attributes in a
ldapsam:editposix setup.

As part of the changes, the default idmap configuration has been
changed to be more coherent with the per-domain configuration.
The parameters "idmap uid", "idmap gid" and "idmap range" are now
deprecated in favour of the systematic "idmap config * : range"
and "idmap config * : backend" parameters. The reason for this change
is that the old options only provided an incomplete and hence deceiving
backwards compatibility, which was a source of many problems with
upgrades. By introducing this change in configuration, it should be
brought to the conciousness of the users that even the simple
id mapping is not working exactly as in Samba 3.0 versions any more.


Endpoint Mapper
---------------

As Microsoft is more and more relying on endpoint mapper and we didn't have a
complete implementation we decided to create an instance for Samba. The
endpoint mapper is like a DNS server but for ports. If you want to talk to a
certain RPC service over TCP/IP, you just ask the endpoint mapper on which
port it is running. Then you can connect to the service and make sure that it
is running.

The code is deactivated by default, because it needs more testing and it
doesn't scale yet. If you want to enable and test the endpoint mapper
you can set "rpc_server:epmapper = daemon" in the smb.conf file.


Internal restructuring
----------------------

Ongoing internal restructuring for better separation of internal subsystem to
achieve a faster build, smaller binaries and cleaner dependencies for the samba3
waf build.


SMB Traffic Analyzer
--------------------

Added the new SMB Traffic Analyzer (SMBTA) VFS module protocol 2
featuring encryption, multiple arguments, and easier parseability. A new
tool 'smbta-util' has been created to control the encryption behaviour
of SMBTA. For compatibility, SMBTA by default operates on version 1.
There are programs consuming the data that the module sends.

More information can be found on
http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/


NFS quota backend on Linux
--------------------------

A new nfs quota backend for Linux has been added that is based
on the existing Solaris/FreeBSD implementation. This allows samba
to communicate correct diskfree information for nfs imports that
are re-exported as samba shares.

   username map cache time	       New	       0
   winbind max clients		       New	       200

   The variable substitutions for %i and %I no longer
   use IPv4 addresses mapped to IPv6, e.g. '::ffff:192.168.0.1',
   if the host has IPv6 enabled. Now %i and %I contain just
   '192.168.0.1'.
