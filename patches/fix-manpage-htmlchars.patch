 ldb is a light weight embedded database library and API. With a programming interface that is very similar to LDAP, ldb can store its data either in a tdb(3) database or in a real LDAP database.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 When used with the tdb backend ldb does not require any database daemon. Instead, ldb function calls are processed immediately by the ldb library, which does IO directly on the database, while allowing multiple readers/writers using operating system byte range locks. This leads to an API with very low overheads, often resulting in speeds of more than 10x what can be achieved with a more traditional LDAP architecture.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 In a taxonomy of databases ldb would sit half way between key/value pair databases (such as berkley db or tdb) and a full LDAP database. With a structured attribute oriented API like LDAP and good indexing capabilities, ldb can be used for quite sophisticated applications that need a light weight database, without the administrative overhead of a full LDAP installation.

 Included with ldb are a number of useful command line tools for manipulating a ldb database. These tools are similar in style to the equivalent ldap command line tools.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 In its default mode of operation with a tdb backend, ldb can also be seen as a "schema-less LDAP". By default ldb does not require a schema, which greatly reduces the complexity of getting started with ldb databases. As the complexity of you application grows you can take advantage of some of the optional schema-like attributes that ldb offers, or you can migrate to using the full LDAP api while keeping your exiting ldb code.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 If you are new to ldb, then I suggest starting with the manual pages for ldbsearch(1) and ldbedit(1), and experimenting with a local database. Then I suggest you look at the ldb_connect(3) and ldb_search(3) manual pages.

 libsmbclient
 is a library toolset that permits applications to manipulate CIFS/SMB network resources using many of the standards POSIX functions available for manipulating local UNIX/Linux files. It permits much more than just browsing, files can be opened and read or written, permissions changed, file times modified, attributes and ACL's can be manipulated, and so on. Of course, its functionality includes all the capabilities commonly called browsing.

 The method of locating the list of workgroups (domains also) varies depending on the setting of the context variable
 (context->options.browse_max_lmb_count). It is the responsibility of the application that calls this library to set this to a sensible value. This is a compile-time option. This value determines the maximum number of local master browsers to query for the list of workgroups. In order to ensure that the list is complete for those present on the network, all master browsers must be querried. If there are a large number of workgroups on the network, the time spent querying will be significant. For small networks (just a few workgroups), it is suggested to set this value to 0, instructing libsmbclient to query all local master browsers. In an environment that has many workgroups a more reasonable setting may be around 3.

 mount.cifs mounts a Linux CIFS filesystem. It is usually invoked indirectly by the

 When the CIFS Unix Extensions are not negotiated, attempt to create device files and fifos in a format compatible with Services for Unix (SFU). In addition retrieve bits 10-12 of the mode via the SETFILEBITS extended attribute (as SFU does). In the future the bottom 9 bits of the mode mode also will be emulated using queries of the security descriptor (ACL). [NB: requires version 1.39 or later of the CIFS VFS. To recognize symlinks and be able to create symlinks in an SFU interoperable form requires version 1.40 or later of the CIFS VFS kernel module.

 Use inode numbers (unique persistent file identifiers) returned by the server instead of automatically generating temporary inode numbers on the client. Although server inode numbers make it easier to spot hardlinked files (as they will have the same inode numbers) and inode numbers may be persistent (which is userful for some sofware), the server does not guarantee that the inode numbers are unique if multiple server side mounts are exported under a single share (since inode numbers on the servers might not be unique if multiple filesystems are mounted under the same shared higher level directory). Note that not all servers support returning server inode numbers, although those that support the CIFS Unix Extensions, and Windows 2000 and later servers typically do support this (although not necessarily on every local server filesystem). Parameter has no effect if the server lacks support for returning inode numbers or equivalent.

 The primary mechanism for making configuration changes and for reading debug information for the cifs vfs is via the Linux /proc filesystem. In the directory
-&#9619;fI/proc/fs/cifs&#9619;fR
+\fI/proc/fs/cifs\fR
 are various configuration files and pseudo files which can display debug information. There are additional startup options such as maximum buffer size and number of buffers which only may be set when the kernel cifs vfs (cifs.ko module) is loaded. These can be seen by running the modinfo utility against the file cifs.ko which will list the options that may be passed to cifs during module installation (device driver load).

 The Samba net utility is meant to work just like the net utility available for windows and DOS. The first argument should be used to specify the protocol to use when executing a certain command. ADS is used for ActiveDirectory, RAP is using for old (Win9x/NT3) clients and RPC can be used for NT4 and Windows 2000. If this argument is omitted, net will try to determine it automatically. Not all commands are available on all protocols.

 Starting with version 3.0.23, a Samba server now supports the ability for non-root users to add user defined shares to be exported using the "net usershare" commands.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 To set this up, first set up your smb.conf by adding to the [global] section: usershare path = /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares Next create the directory /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares, change the owner to root and set the group owner to the UNIX group who should have the ability to create usershares, for example a group called "serverops". Set the permissions on /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares to 01770. (Owner and group all access, no access for others, plus the sticky bit, which means that a file in that directory can be renamed or deleted only by the owner of the file). Finally, tell smbd how many usershares you will allow by adding to the [global] section of smb.conf a line such as : usershare max shares = 100. To allow 100 usershare definitions. Now, members of the UNIX group "serverops" can create user defined shares on demand using the commands below.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 The usershare commands are:
-&#8962;IP "" 4

 "path" specifies the absolute pathname on the system to be exported. Restrictions may be put on this, see the global smb.conf parameters: "usershare owner only", "usershare prefix allow list", and "usershare prefix deny list".
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 The optional "comment" parameter is the comment that will appear on the share when browsed to by a client.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 The optional "acl" field specifies which users have read and write access to the entire share. Note that guest connections are not allowed unless the smb.conf parameter "usershare allow guests" has been set. The definition of a user defined share acl is: "user:permission", where user is a valid username on the system and permission can be "F", "R", or "D". "F" stands for "full permissions", ie. read and write permissions. "D" stands for "deny" for a user, ie. prevent this user from accessing this share. "R" stands for "read only", ie. only allow read access to this share (no creation of new files or directories or writing to files).
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 The default if no "acl" is given is "Everyone:R", which means any authenticated user has read-only access.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 The optional "guest_ok" has the same effect as the parameter of the same name in smb.conf, in that it allows guest access to this user defined share. This parameter is only allowed if the global parameter "usershare allow guests" has been set to true in the smb.conf.

 This program is part of the

+\fBsamba\fR(7)
 suite.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 nmbd
 is a server that understands and can reply to NetBIOS over IP name service requests, like those produced by SMB/CIFS clients such as Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP and LanManager clients. It also participates in the browsing protocols which make up the Windows "Network Neighborhood" view.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 SMB/CIFS clients, when they start up, may wish to locate an SMB/CIFS server. That is, they wish to know what IP number a specified host is using.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 Amongst other services,
 nmbd
 will listen for such requests, and if its own NetBIOS name is specified it will respond with the IP number of the host it is running on. Its "own NetBIOS name" is by default the primary DNS name of the host it is running on, but this can be overridden by the
 netbios name in
-&#9619;fIsmb.conf&#9619;fR. Thus
+\fIsmb.conf\fR. Thus
 nmbd
 will reply to broadcast queries for its own name(s). Additional names for
 nmbd
 to respond on can be set via parameters in the
-&#9619;fBsmb.conf&#9619;fR(5)
+\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
 configuration file.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 nmbd
 can also be used as a WINS (Windows Internet Name Server) server. What this basically means is that it will act as a WINS database server, creating a database from name registration requests that it receives and replying to queries from clients for these names.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 In addition,
 nmbd
 can act as a WINS proxy, relaying broadcast queries from clients that do not understand how to talk the WINS protocol to a WINS server.

 ntlm_auth
 is a helper utility that authenticates users using NT/LM authentication. It returns 0 if the users is authenticated successfully and 1 if access was denied. ntlm_auth uses winbind to access the user and authentication data for a domain.

 Squid
 and
 mod_ntlm_winbind)

 The pdbedit tool uses the passdb modular interface and is independent from the kind of users database used (currently there are smbpasswd, ldap, nis+ and tdb based and more can be added without changing the tool).

 The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged.

 The MSRPC over SMB code has been developed from examining Network traces. No documentation is available from the original creators (Microsoft) on how MSRPC over SMB works, or how the individual MSRPC services work. Microsoft's implementation of these services has been demonstrated (and reported) to be... a bit flaky in places.

 Each section in the configuration file (except for the [global] section) describes a shared resource (known as a

+.PP
 There are three special sections, [global], [homes] and [printers], which are described under
 \fBspecial sections\fR. The following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions.

+.PP
 A share consists of a directory to which access is being given plus a description of the access rights which are granted to the user of the service. Some housekeeping options are also specifiable.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 Sections are either file share services (used by the client as an extension of their native file systems) or printable services (used by the client to access print services on the host running the server).
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 Sections may be designated
 \fBguest\fR
 services, in which case no password is required to access them. A specified UNIX
 \fBguest account\fR
 is used to define access privileges in this case.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 Sections other than guest services will require a password to access them. The client provides the username. As older clients only provide passwords and not usernames, you may specify a list of usernames to check against the password using the
 user =
 option in the share definition. For modern clients such as Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000, this should not be necessary.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 The access rights granted by the server are masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest UNIX user by the host system. The server does not grant more access than the host system grants.
-&#8962;PP

 If a section called [homes] is included in the configuration file, services connecting clients to their home directories can be created on the fly by the server.
-&#8962;PP

 When the connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned. If a match is found, it is used. If no match is found, the requested section name is treated as a username and looked up in the local password file. If the name exists and the correct password has been given, a share is created by cloning the [homes] section.

 A similar process occurs if the requested section name is
 \fBhomes\fR, except that the share name is not changed to that of the requesting user. This method of using the [homes] section works well if different users share a client PC.
-&#8962;PP

 The [homes] section can specify all the parameters a normal service section can specify, though some make more sense than others. The following is a typical and suitable [homes] section:

 An important point is that if guest access is specified in the [homes] section, all home directories will be visible to all clients
 \fBwithout a password\fR. In the very unlikely event that this is actually desirable, it is wise to also specify
 \fBread only access\fR.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 The
 \fBbrowseable\fR
 flag for auto home directories will be inherited from the global browseable flag, not the [homes] browseable flag. This is useful as it means setting
 \fBbrowseable = no\fR
 in the [homes] section will hide the [homes] share but make any auto home directories visible.

 Each alias should be an acceptable printer name for your printing subsystem. In the [global] section, specify the new file as your printcap. The server will only recognize names found in your pseudo-printcap, which of course can contain whatever aliases you like.

 An alias, by the way, is defined as any component of the first entry of a printcap record. Records are separated by newlines, components (if there are more than one) are separated by vertical bar symbols (|).

 acl group control (S)
-&#8962;RS 4

 In a POSIX filesystem, only the owner of a file or directory and the superuser can modify the permissions and ACLs on a file. If this parameter is set, then Samba overrides this restriction, and also allows the
 \fBprimary group owner\fR

-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 On a Windows server, groups may be the owner of a file or directory - thus allowing anyone in that group to modify the permissions on it. This allows the delegation of security controls on a point in the filesystem to the group owner of a directory and anything below it also owned by that group. This means there are multiple people with permissions to modify ACLs on a file or directory, easing managability.
-&#8962;sp

 default devmode (S)
-&#8962;RS 4
+.RS 4
 This parameter is only applicable to
 printable services. When smbd is serving Printer Drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients, each printer on the Samba server has a Device Mode which defines things such as paper size and orientation and duplex settings. The device mode can only correctly be generated by the printer driver itself (which can only be executed on a Win32 platform). Because smbd is unable to execute the driver code to generate the device mode, the default behavior is to set this field to NULL.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 Most problems with serving printer drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients can be traced to a problem with the generated device mode. Certain drivers will do things such as crashing the client's Explorer.exe with a NULL devmode. However, other printer drivers can cause the client's spooler service (spoolsv.exe) to die if the devmode was not created by the driver itself (i.e. smbd generates a default devmode).
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 This parameter should be used with care and tested with the printer driver in question. It is better to leave the device mode to NULL and let the Windows client set the correct values. Because drivers do not do this all the time, setting
 default devmode = yes
 will instruct smbd to generate a default one.

 When a directory is created, the necessary permissions are calculated according to the mapping from DOS modes to UNIX permissions, and the resulting UNIX mode is then bit-wise 'AND'ed with this parameter.

As the two second call rounds any odd second down, then if the file has a timestamp of an odd number of seconds then the two timestamps will not match and Visual C++ will keep reporting the file has changed.

 fake directory create times (S)

 NTFS and Windows VFAT file systems keep a create time for all files and directories. This is not the same as the ctime - status change time - that Unix keeps, so Samba by default reports the earliest of the various times Unix does keep. Setting this parameter for a share causes Samba to always report midnight 1-1-1980 as the create time for directories.

 This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++ when used against Samba shares. Visual C++ generated makefiles have the object directory as a dependency for each object file, and a make rule to create the directory. Also, when NMAKE compares timestamps it uses the creation time when examining a directory. Thus the object directory will be created if it does not exist, but once it does exist it will always have an earlier timestamp than the object files it contains.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 However, Unix time semantics mean that the create time reported by Samba will be updated whenever a file is created or or deleted in the directory. NMAKE finds all object files in the object directory. The timestamp of the last one built is then compared to the timestamp of the object directory. If the directory's timestamp if newer, then all object files will be rebuilt. Enabling this option ensures directories always predate their contents and an NMAKE build will proceed as expected.

 force group (S)

+.RS 4
 This specifies a UNIX group name that will be assigned as the default primary group for all users connecting to this service. This is useful for sharing files by ensuring that all access to files on service will use the named group for their permissions checking. Thus, by assigning permissions for this group to the files and directories within this service the Samba administrator can restrict or allow sharing of these files.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 In Samba 2.0.5 and above this parameter has extended functionality in the following way. If the group name listed here has a '+' character prepended to it then the current user accessing the share only has the primary group default assigned to this group if they are already assigned as a member of that group. This allows an administrator to decide that only users who are already in a particular group will create files with group ownership set to that group. This gives a finer granularity of ownership assignment. For example, the setting
-&#9619;fIforce group = +sys&#9619;fR
+\fIforce group = +sys\fR
 means that only users who are already in group sys will have their default primary group assigned to sys when accessing this Samba share. All other users will retain their ordinary primary group.

+.RS 4
 When printing from Windows NT (or later), each printer in
-&#9619;fIsmb.conf&#9619;fR
+\fIsmb.conf\fR
 has two associated names which can be used by the client. The first is the sharename (or shortname) defined in smb.conf. This is the only printername available for use by Windows 9x clients. The second name associated with a printer can be seen when browsing to the "Printers" (or "Printers and Faxes") folder on the Samba server. This is referred to simply as the printername (not to be confused with the
-&#9619;fIprinter name&#9619;fR
+\fIprinter name\fR
 option).
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 When assigning a new driver to a printer on a remote Windows compatible print server such as Samba, the Windows client will rename the printer to match the driver name just uploaded. This can result in confusion for users when multiple printers are bound to the same driver. To prevent Samba from allowing the printer's printername to differ from the sharename defined in smb.conf, set
-&#9619;fIforce printername = yes&#9619;fR.
-&#8962;sp
+\fIforce printername = yes\fR.

 Be aware that enabling this parameter may affect migrating printers from a Windows server to Samba since Windows has no way to force the sharename and printername to match.

 It is recommended that this parameter's value not be changed once the printer is in use by clients as this could cause a user not be able to delete printer connections from their local Printers folder.

 This is designed to allow Windows NT clients to copy files and folders containing ACLs that were created locally on the client machine and contain users local to that machine only (no domain users) to be copied to a Samba server (usually with XCOPY /O) and have the unknown userid and groupid of the file owner map to the current connected user.

 This user name only gets used once a connection is established. Thus clients still need to connect as a valid user and supply a valid password. Once connected, all file operations will be performed as the "forced user", no matter what username the client connected as. This can be very useful.

 Editposix is an option that leverages ldapsam:trusted to make it simpler to manage a domain controller eliminating the need to set up custom scripts to add and manage the posix users and groups. This option will instead directly manipulate the ldap tree to create, remove and modify user and group entries. This option also requires a running winbindd as it is used to allocate new uids/gids on user/group creation. The allocation range must be therefore configured.
-&#8962;sp

 To use this option, a basic ldap tree must be provided and the ldap suffix parameters must be properly configured. On virgin servers the default users and groups (Administrator, Guest, Domain Users, Domain Admins, Domain Guests) can be precreated with the command
 net sam provision. To run this command the ldap server must be running, Winindd must be running and the smb.conf ldap options must be properly configured. The typical ldap setup used with the

 ldapsam:trusted (G)
-&#8962;RS 4
+.RS 4
 By default, Samba as a Domain Controller with an LDAP backend needs to use the Unix-style NSS subsystem to access user and group information. Due to the way Unix stores user information in /etc/passwd and /etc/group this inevitably leads to inefficiencies. One important question a user needs to know is the list of groups he is member of. The plain UNIX model involves a complete enumeration of the file /etc/group and its NSS counterparts in LDAP. UNIX has optimized functions to enumerate group membership. Sadly, other functions that are used to deal with user and group attributes lack such optimization.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 To make Samba scale well in large environments, the
 ldapsam:trusted = yes option assumes that the complete user and group database that is relevant to Samba is stored in LDAP with the standard posixAccount/posixGroup attributes. It further assumes that the Samba auxiliary object classes are stored together with the POSIX data in the same LDAP object. If these assumptions are met,
 ldapsam:trusted = yes can be activated and Samba can bypass the NSS system to query user group memberships. Optimized LDAP queries can greatly speed up domain logon and administration tasks. Depending on the size of the LDAP database a factor of 100 or more for common queries is easily achieved.

 Level2, or read-only oplocks allow Windows NT clients that have an oplock on a file to downgrade from a read-write oplock to a read-only oplock once a second client opens the file (instead of releasing all oplocks on a second open, as in traditional, exclusive oplocks). This allows all openers of the file that support level2 oplocks to cache the file for read-ahead only (ie. they may not cache writes or lock requests) and increases performance for many accesses of files that are not commonly written (such as application .EXE files).

 logon home (G)
-&#8962;RS 4
+.RS 4
 This parameter specifies the home directory location when a Win95/98 or NT Workstation logs into a Samba PDC. It allows you to do
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 
-C:\>&#9619;fBNET USE H: /HOME&#9619;fR
-&#8962;sp
+C:\>\fBNET USE H: /HOME\fR
+.sp
 from a command prompt, for example.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 This parameter can be used with Win9X workstations to ensure that roaming profiles are stored in a subdirectory of the user's home directory. This is done in the following way:
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 
 logon home = \\\\%N\\%U\\profile
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 This tells Samba to return the above string, with substitutions made when a client requests the info, generally in a NetUserGetInfo request. Win9X clients truncate the info to \\server\share when a user does
 net use /home
 but use the whole string when dealing with profiles.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 Note that in prior versions of Samba, the
 logon path was returned rather than
-&#9619;fIlogon home&#9619;fR. This broke
+\fIlogon home\fR. This broke
 net use /home
 but allowed profiles outside the home directory. The current implementation is correct, and can be used for profiles if you use the above trick.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 Disable this feature by setting
 logon home = "" - using the empty string.
-&#8962;sp

 This option is only useful if Samba is set up as a logon server.

 This parameter specifies the directory where roaming profiles (Desktop, NTuser.dat, etc) are stored. Contrary to previous versions of these manual pages, it has nothing to do with Win 9X roaming profiles. To find out how to handle roaming profiles for Win 9X system, see the
 logon home parameter.

 This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine. It also specifies the directory from which the "Application Data",

-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 The share and the path must be readable by the user for the preferences and directories to be loaded onto the Windows NT client. The share must be writeable when the user logs in for the first time, in order that the Windows NT client can create the NTuser.dat and other directories. Thereafter, the directories and any of the contents can, if required, be made read-only. It is not advisable that the NTuser.dat file be made read-only - rename it to NTuser.man to achieve the desired effect (a
 \fBMAN\fRdatory profile).
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 Windows clients can sometimes maintain a connection to the [homes] share, even though there is no user logged in. Therefore, it is vital that the logon path does not include a reference to the homes share (i.e. setting this parameter to \\%N\homes\profile_path will cause problems).

Where the tdbsam or ldapsam passdb backend is used, at the time the user account is created the value configured for this parameter is written to the passdb backend and that value will over-ride the parameter value present in the smb.conf file. Any error present in the passdb backend account record must be editted using the appropriate tool (pdbedit on the command-line, or any other locally provided system tool).
 
 Note that this option is only useful if Samba is set up as a domain controller.
-&#8962;sp

 Disable the use of roaming profiles by setting the value of this parameter to the empty string. For example,
 logon path = "". Take note that even if the default setting in the smb.conf file is the empty string, any value specified in the user account settings in the passdb backend will over-ride the effect of setting this parameter to null. Disabling of all roaming profile use requires that the user account settings must also be blank.

 See the section on
 name mangling for details on how to control the mangling process.
-&#8962;sp

 If mangling is used then the mangling algorithm is as follows:
 \(bu
 The first (up to) five alphanumeric characters before the rightmost dot of the filename are preserved, forced to upper case, and appear as the first (up to) five characters of the mangled name.
 .TP
 \(bu
 A tilde "~" is appended to the first part of the mangled name, followed by a two-character unique sequence, based on the original root name (i.e., the original filename minus its final extension). The final extension is included in the hash calculation only if it contains any upper case characters or is longer than three characters.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 Note that the character to use may be specified using the
 mangling char option, if you don't like '~'.
 .TP
 \(bu
 Files whose UNIX name begins with a dot will be presented as DOS hidden files. The mangled name will be created as for other filenames, but with the leading dot removed and "___" as its extension regardless of actual original extension (that's three underscores).
-&#8962;IP "" 4
+.IP "" 4
 The two-digit hash value consists of upper case alphanumeric characters.

 This algorithm can cause name collisions only if files in a directory share the same first five alphanumeric characters. The probability of such a clash is 1/1300.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 The name mangling (if enabled) allows a file to be copied between UNIX directories from Windows/DOS while retaining the long UNIX filename. UNIX files can be renamed to a new extension from Windows/DOS and will retain the same basename. Mangled names do not change between sessions.

 Some client/server combinations have difficulty with mixed-case passwords.

 After a print job has finished spooling to a service, this command will be used via a
 system()
 call to process the spool file. Typically the command specified will submit the spool file to the host's printing subsystem, but there is no requirement that this be the case. The server will not remove the spool file, so whatever command you specify should remove the spool file when it has been processed, otherwise you will need to manually remove old spool files.
-&#8962;sp

 The print command is simply a text string. It will be used verbatim after macro substitutions have been made:
-&#8962;sp

 %s, %f - the path to the spool file name
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 %p - the appropriate printer name

 profile acls (S)
-&#8962;RS 4
+.RS 4
 This boolean parameter was added to fix the problems that people have been having with storing user profiles on Samba shares from Windows 2000 or Windows XP clients. New versions of Windows 2000 or Windows XP service packs do security ACL checking on the owner and ability to write of the profile directory stored on a local workstation when copied from a Samba share.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 When not in domain mode with winbindd then the security info copied onto the local workstation has no meaning to the logged in user (SID) on that workstation so the profile storing fails. Adding this parameter onto a share used for profile storage changes two things about the returned Windows ACL. Firstly it changes the owner and group owner of all reported files and directories to be BUILTIN\\Administrators, BUILTIN\\Users respectively (SIDs S-1-5-32-544, S-1-5-32-545). Secondly it adds an ACE entry of "Full Control" to the SID BUILTIN\\Users to every returned ACL. This will allow any Windows 2000 or XP workstation user to access the profile.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 Note that if you have multiple users logging on to a workstation then in order to prevent them from being able to access each others profiles you must remove the "Bypass traverse checking" advanced user right. This will prevent access to other users profile directories as the top level profile directory (named after the user) is created by the workstation profile code and has an ACL restricting entry to the directory tree to the owning user.

 the above line would cause

 The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast addresses of the remote networks, but can also be the IP addresses of known browse masters if your network config is that stable.

 The script has all responsibility to rename all the necessary data that is accessible in this posix method. This can mean different requirements for different backends. The tdbsam and smbpasswd backends will take care of the contents of their respective files, so the script is responsible only for changing the POSIX username, and other data that may required for your circumstances, such as home directory. Please also consider whether or not you need to rename the actual home directories themselves. The ldapsam backend will not make any changes, because of the potential issues with renaming the LDAP naming attribute. In this case the script is responsible for changing the attribute that samba uses (uid) for locating users, as well as any data that needs to change for other applications using the same directory.

 This boolean option controls whether an incoming session setup should kill other connections coming from the same IP. This matches the default Windows 2003 behaviour. Setting this parameter to yes becomes necessary when you have a flaky network and windows decides to reconnect while the old connection still has files with share modes open. These files become inaccessible over the new connection. The client sends a zero VC on the new connection, and Windows 2003 kills all other connections coming from the same IP. This way the locked files are accessible again. Please be aware that enabling this option will kill connections behind a masquerading router.

 With the introduction of MS-RPC based printing support for Windows NT/2000 client in Samba 2.2, a "Printers..." folder will appear on Samba hosts in the share listing.

 smb encrypt (S)
-&#8962;RS 4

 This is a new feature introduced with Samba 3.2 and above. It is an extension to the SMB/CIFS protocol negotiated as part of the UNIX extensions. SMB encryption uses the GSSAPI (SSPI on Windows) ability to encrypt and sign every request/response in a SMB protocol stream. When enabled it provides a secure method of SMB/CIFS communication, similar to an ssh protected session, but using SMB/CIFS authentication to negotiate encryption and signing keys. Currently this is only supported by Samba 3.2 smbclient, and hopefully soon Linux CIFSFS and MacOS/X clients. Windows clients do not support this feature.

This is a convenience option to allow the change over to encrypted passwords to be made over a longer period.

 use client driver (S)
-&#8962;RS 4
+.RS 4
 This parameter applies only to Windows NT/2000 clients. It has no effect on Windows 95/98/ME clients. When serving a printer to Windows NT/2000 clients without first installing a valid printer driver on the Samba host, the client will be required to install a local printer driver. From this point on, the client will treat the print as a local printer and not a network printer connection. This is much the same behavior that will occur when
 disable spoolss = yes.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 The differentiating factor is that under normal circumstances, the NT/2000 client will attempt to open the network printer using MS-RPC. The problem is that because the client considers the printer to be local, it will attempt to issue the OpenPrinterEx() call requesting access rights associated with the logged on user. If the user possesses local administator rights but not root privilege on the Samba host (often the case), the OpenPrinterEx() call will fail. The result is that the client will now display an "Access Denied; Unable to connect" message in the printer queue window (even though jobs may successfully be printed).
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 If this parameter is enabled for a printer, then any attempt to open the printer with the PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER right is mapped to PRINTER_ACCESS_USE instead. Thus allowing the OpenPrinterEx() call to succeed.

 Samba relies on the underlying UNIX security. This parameter does not restrict who can login, it just offers hints to the Samba server as to what usernames might correspond to the supplied password. Users can login as whoever they please and they will be able to do no more damage than if they started a telnet session. The daemon runs as the user that they log in as, so they cannot do anything that user cannot do.

 username map (G)
-&#8962;RS 4
+.RS 4
 This option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server. This can be used for several purposes. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX box uses. The other is to map multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share files.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 Please note that for user or share mode security, the username map is applied prior to validating the user credentials. Domain member servers (domain or ads) apply the username map after the user has been successfully authenticated by the domain controller and require fully qualified enties in the map table (e.g. biddle = DOMAIN\foo).
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 The map file is parsed line by line. Each line should contain a single UNIX username on the left then a '=' followed by a list of usernames on the right. The list of usernames on the right may contain names of the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX username in that group. The special client name '*' is a wildcard and matches any name. Each line of the map file may be up to 1023 characters long.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and comparing it with each username on the right hand side of the '=' signs. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the name on the left. Processing then continues with the next line.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 If any line begins with a '#' or a ';' then it is ignored.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 If any line begins with an '!' then the processing will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the line. Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed. Using '!' is most useful when you have a wildcard mapping line later in the file.

 write cache size (S)

+.RS 4
 If this integer parameter is set to non-zero value, Samba will create an in-memory cache for each oplocked file (it does
 \fBnot\fR
 do this for non-oplocked files). All writes that the client does not request to be flushed directly to disk will be stored in this cache if possible. The cache is flushed onto disk when a write comes in whose offset would not fit into the cache or when the file is closed by the client. Reads for the file are also served from this cache if the data is stored within it.
-&#8962;sp
+.sp
 This cache allows Samba to batch client writes into a more efficient write size for RAID disks (i.e. writes may be tuned to be the RAID stripe size) and can improve performance on systems where the disk subsystem is a bottleneck but there is free memory for userspace programs.

 The masks specified to the mget and mput commands act as filters for directories rather than files when recursion is toggled ON.

+.sp
 The mask specified with the mask command is necessary to filter files within those directories. For example, if the mask specified in an mget command is "source*" and the mask specified with the mask command is "*.c" and recursion is toggled ON, the mget command will retrieve all files matching "*.c" in all directories below and including all directories matching "source*" in the current working directory.
-&#8962;sp

 Note that the value for mask defaults to blank (equivalent to "*") and remains so until the mask command is used to change it. It retains the most recently specified value indefinitely. To avoid unexpected results it would be wise to change the value of mask back to "*" after using the mget or mput commands.

 smbd
 is the server daemon that provides filesharing and printing services to Windows clients. The server provides filespace and printer services to clients using the SMB (or CIFS) protocol. This is compatible with the LanManager protocol, and can service LanManager clients. These include MSCLIENT 3.0 for DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, OS/2, DAVE for Macintosh, and smbfs for Linux.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 An extensive description of the services that the server can provide is given in the man page for the configuration file controlling the attributes of those services (see
-&#9619;fBsmb.conf&#9619;fR(5). This man page will not describe the services, but will concentrate on the administrative aspects of running the server.

+\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
 manual page should be regarded as mandatory reading before proceeding with installation.

 A session is created whenever a client requests one. Each client gets a copy of the server for each session. This copy then services all connections made by the client during that session. When all connections from its client are closed, the copy of the server for that client terminates.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 The configuration file, and any files that it includes, are automatically reloaded every minute, if they change. You can force a reload by sending a SIGHUP to the server. Reloading the configuration file will not affect connections to any service that is already established. Either the user will have to disconnect from the service, or

 Samba uses PAM for authentication (when presented with a plaintext password), for account checking (is this account disabled?) and for session management. The degree too which samba supports PAM is restricted by the limitations of the SMB protocol and the

 Most messages are reasonably self-explanatory.

This is the same password used by Windows 95/98 machines. Note that this password hash is regarded as weak as it is vulnerable to dictionary attacks and if two users choose the same password this entry will be identical (i.e. the password is not "salted" as the UNIX password is).

 The smbpasswd program has several different functions, depending on whether it is run by the

 umount.cifs unmounts a Linux CIFS filesystem. It can be invoked indirectly by the
-&#9619;fBumount&#9619;fR(8)
+\fBumount\fR(8)
 command when umount.cifs is in /sbin directory, unless you specify the "-i" option to umount. Specifying -i to umount avoids execution of umount helpers such as umount.cifs. The umount.cifs command only works in Linux, and the kernel must support the cifs filesystem. The CIFS protocol is the successor to the SMB protocol and is supported by most Windows servers and many other commercial servers and Network Attached Storage appliances as well as by the popular Open Source server Samba.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 The umount.cifs utility detaches the local directory
 \fBmount-point\fR
 from the corresponding UNC name (exported network resource) and frees the associated kernel resources. It is possible to set the mode for umount.cifs to setuid root (or equivalently update the /etc/permissions file) to allow non-root users to umount shares to directories for which they have write permission. The umount.cifs utility is typically not needed if unmounts need only be performed by root users, or if user mounts and unmounts can rely on specifying explicit entries in /etc/fstab See

 This command is normally intended to be installed setuid (since root users can already run unmount). An alternative to using umount.cifs is to add specfic entries for the user mounts that you wish a particular user or users to mount and unmount to /etc/fstab

 The primary mechanism for making configuration changes and for reading debug information for the cifs vfs is via the Linux /proc filesystem. In the directory
-&#9619;fI/proc/fs/cifs&#9619;fR
+\fI/proc/fs/cifs\fR
 are various configuration files and pseudo files which can display debug information. For more information see the kernel file

 At this time umount.cifs does not lock the mount table using the same lock as the umount utility does, so do not attempt to do multiple unmounts from different processes (and in particular unmounts of a cifs mount and another type of filesystem mount at the same time).
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 If the same mount point is mounted multiple times by cifs, umount.cifs will remove all of the matching entries from the mount table (although umount.cifs will actually only unmount the last one), rather than only removing the last matching entry in /etc/mtab. The pseudofile /proc/mounts will display correct information though, and the lack of an entry in /etc/mtab does not prevent subsequent unmounts.
-&#8962;PP
+.PP
 Note that the typical response to a bug report is a suggestion to try the latest version first. So please try doing that first, and always include which versions you use of relevant software when reporting bugs (minimum: umount.cifs (try umount.cifs -V), kernel (see /proc/version) and server type you are trying to contact.

 Users and groups on a Windows NT server are assigned a security id (SID) which is globally unique when the user or group is created. To convert the Windows NT user or group into a unix user or group, a mapping between SIDs and unix user and group ids is required. This is one of the jobs that

 As winbindd users and groups are resolved from a server, user and group ids are allocated from a specified range. This is done on a first come, first served basis, although all existing users and groups will be mapped as soon as a client performs a user or group enumeration command. The allocated unix ids are stored in a database and will be remembered.
