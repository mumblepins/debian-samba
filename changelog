samba (3.9.0+SVN12692-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * First upload to Debian main.
  * Remove a few unused files in the packaging.
  * Rename samba-server package to just samba, for consistency with the
    Samba 3 packaging.
    * Rename samba.samba.init to samba.init, now that the init script and the
      server package are called the same.
  * Be more explicit about what happens to the administrator password the
    user enters.
  * Change SOURCEPATH in debian/rules to reflect that we now have the
    packaging in debian/, not packaging/debian/. This will have to be reverted
    whenever upstream syncs with us.
  * Attempt to upgrade from Samba 3 if that's what the user tries to do.
    * Copy upgrade script into /usr/lib/samba/setup.
    * Check for upgrade from << 3.9.0 in config, and ask the user for upgrade
      if relevant.
    * Check for upgrade from << 3.9.0 in postinst, and upgrade if the user
      wished to.
  * Only provision in samba.postinst if we're doing a fresh install.
  * Make samba-client Replaces/Conflicts smbclient.
  * Rename samba-swat to swat, and add a dependency from swat to samba.
  * Change debhelper compatibility level to 5.
  * Remove leftover, unused init.d script from debmake.
  * Don't give --pidfile to start-stop-daemon when stopping -- current
    versions of Samba 4 won't die when the parent is killed.
  * Removed debmake comment from debian/rules, it's hardly relevant any more.
  * Support purging properly in postrm, both for samba and samba-common
    (adapted from the Samba 3 packaging).
  * Copied Uploaders: line from Samba 3 packaging, adding myself.
  * Updated README.debian somewhat, and renamed to use a capital D.
  * Don't ask about an administrator password -- just let the provisioning
    scripts make up a random one.
    * Updated README.Debian to show the user how to change the password.
    * Make samba recommend ldb-tools.
