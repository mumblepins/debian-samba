samba (3.9.0+SVN12726-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload to Debian main.

  * Package renaming to get more in line with Samba 3 packaging:
    * Rename samba-server package to just samba, for consistency with the
      Samba 3 packaging.
      * Rename samba.samba.init to samba.init, now that the init script and the
        server package are called the same.
    * Rename samba-swat to swat, and add a dependency from swat to samba.

  * debian/rules changes:
    * Change SOURCEPATH to reflect that we now have the packaging in debian/,
      not packaging/debian/. This will have to be reverted whenever upstream
      syncs with us.
    * Removed debmake comment, it's hardly relevant any more.
    * Removed comment that there aren't any architecture-independent packages
      (because there are).
    * Remove redundant "package=samba" variable.
    * Do "make pch ; make all" instead of "make proto ; -make pch ; make all";
      some build system bug prevents us from just doing "make pch all", but
      since we're more or less guaranteed a recent gcc version, the pch target
      shouldn't fail, so we won't allow it to.
    * Remove autogen.sh call from configure; it should be done in the
      upstream tarball, not in maintainer scripts.

  * debian/control changes:
    * Copied Uploaders: line from Samba 3 packaging, adding myself.
    * Rename samba-client package to samba-clients.
    * Make samba-clients Replaces/Conflicts smbclient.
    * Build-depend on docbook-xml, not just docbook-xsl -- the documentation
      needs data from both to build.
    * Move the samba binary package to the top, so it's the one receiving
      the README.* files, among others.

  * Maintainer script changes:
    * Attempt to upgrade from Samba 3 if that's what the user tries to do.
      * Copy upgrade script into /usr/lib/samba/setup.
      * Check for upgrade from << 3.9.0 in config, and ask the user for upgrade
        if relevant.
      * Check for upgrade from << 3.9.0 in postinst, and upgrade if the user
        wished to.
    * Only provision in samba.postinst if we're doing a fresh install.
    * Support purging properly in postrm, both for samba and samba-common
      (adapted from the Samba 3 packaging).
    * Don't ask about an administrator password -- just let the provisioning
      scripts make up a random one.
      * Updated README.Debian to show the user how to change the password.
      * Make samba recommend ldb-tools.
    * Install README.building along with all the other documentation.
    * Don't try to ask about the "done" question, which we nuked in a previous
      release.

  * Updated debian/copyright.
    * Added Samba copyright holders.
    * Noted that talloc, ldb and tdb are under the LGPL.
    * Added copyright holders and licensing for the packaging itself.

  * Remove a few unused files in the packaging.
  * Change debhelper compatibility level to 5.
    * Update versioned depends accordingly.
  * Don't give --pidfile to start-stop-daemon when stopping -- current
    versions of Samba 4 won't die when the parent is killed.
  * Updated README.debian somewhat, and renamed to use a capital D.
  * Rewritten README.building, to reflect the magic that has to be done
    with the package in another repository.
  * Update po/POTFILES.in to reflect name change (from samba4-server ->
    samba-server -> samba).
