Description: a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains all the components necessary to turn your
 Debian GNU/Linux box into a powerful file and printer server.
 .
 Currently, the Samba Debian packages consist of the following:
 .
  samba - LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix.
  samba-common - Samba common files used by both the server and the client.
  smbclient - LanManager-like simple client for Unix.
  swat - Samba Web Administration Tool
  samba-doc - Samba documentation.
  samba-doc-pdf - Samba documentation in PDF format.
  smbfs - Mount and umount commands for the smbfs (kernels 2.2.x and above).
  libpam-smbpass - pluggable authentication module for SMB/CIFS password 
                   database
  libsmbclient - Shared library that allows applications to talk to SMB/CIFS
                 servers
  libsmbclient-dev - libsmbclient shared libraries
  libwbclient0 - Shared library for interfacing with the winbind service
  winbind - Service to resolve user and group information from Windows NT 
            servers
 .
 It is possible to install a subset of these packages depending on
 your particular needs. For example, to access other SMB/CIFS servers you
 should only need the smbclient and samba-common packages.

Package: samba-common
Architecture: any
Depends: libpam-modules, ucf, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Replaces: samba (<< 3.0.20b-1)
Description: Samba common files used by both the server and the client
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains the common files that are used by both the server
 (provided in the samba package) and the client (provided in the smbclient
 package).

Package: samba-tools
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: tools provided by the Samba suite
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains tools such as smbtorture which may help
 testing the performance of CIFS servers or clients.

Package: smbclient
Architecture: any
Depends: samba-common (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}
Replaces: samba (<< 2.999+3.0.alpha21-4), smbget
Provides: samba-client
Suggests: smbfs
Description: a LanManager-like simple client for Unix
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains some client components of the Samba suite. In
 particular it includes the command line utilities smbclient, smbtar,
 and smbspool. If you want to mount shares exported from Microsoft
 Windows machines or a Samba server you must install the smbfs package.

Package: swat
Architecture: any
Depends: samba (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, openbsd-inetd | inet-superserver
Recommends: samba-doc (= ${source:Version})
Description: Samba Web Administration Tool
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains the components of the Samba suite that are needed
 for Web administration of the Samba server.
 .
 SWAT will rewrite the smb.conf file. It will rearrange the entries and
 delete all comments, include= and copy= options. If you use a carefully
 crafted smb.conf, you should probably avoid using SWAT.

Package: samba-doc
Section: doc
Architecture: all
Suggests: samba-doc-pdf
Description: Samba documentation
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains all the documentation that comes in the original
 tarball, except in PDF format.

Package: samba-doc-pdf
Section: doc
Architecture: all
Description: Samba documentation (PDF format)
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.

Package: smbfs
Section: otherosfs
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: netbase (>= 2.02), samba-common (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}
Suggests: smbclient
Replaces: smbfsx
Description: mount and umount commands for the smbfs (for kernels >= than 2.2.x)
 Smbfs is a filesystem which understands the SMB/CIFS protocol.
 This is the protocol Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT or
 LAN Manager use to talk to each other. It was inspired by
 samba, the program by Andrew Tridgell that turns any unix
 site into a file server for DOS or Windows clients.
 .
 If you want to use command-line utilities like smbclient, smbtar
 and/or smbspool you just need to install the smbclient package.

Package: libpam-smbpass
Section: admin
Priority: extra
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, samba-common (= ${binary:Version})
Suggests: samba
Description: pluggable authentication module for SMB/CIFS password database
 This is a stackable PAM module that allows a system administrator to easily
 migrate to using encrypted passwords for Samba and to keep smb passwords in
 sync with unix passwords.  Unlike other solutions, it does this without
 requiring users to change their existing passwords or login to Samba using
 cleartext passwords.

Package: libsmbclient
Section: libs
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: shared library that allows applications to talk to SMB/CIFS servers

Package: libsmbclient-dev
Section: libdevel
Priority: extra
Architecture: any
Depends: libsmbclient (= ${binary:Version})
Description: libsmbclient static libraries and headers

 This package provides the winbindd daemon, which provides a
 service for the Name Service Switch capability that is present
 in most modern C libraries (like the GNU C Library - glibc.)
 .
 The service provided by winbindd is called `winbind' and
 can be used to resolve user and group information from a
 Windows NT server. The service can also provide authentication
 services via an associated PAM module.
