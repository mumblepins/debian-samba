samba (3.0.26a-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Default printing system has changed from BSD to CUPS

    Previous versions of this package were configured to use BSD lpr as the
    default printing system.  With this version of Samba, the default has
    been changed to CUPS for consistency with the current default printer
    handling in the rest of the system.

    If you wish to continue using the BSD printing interface from Samba, you
    will need to set "printing = bsd" manually in /etc/samba/smb.conf.  If
    you wish to use CUPS printing but have previously set any of the
    "print command", "lpq command", or "lprm command" options in smb.conf,
    you will want to remove these settings from your config.  Otherwise, if
    you have the cupsys package installed, Samba should begin to use it
    automatically with no action on your part.
