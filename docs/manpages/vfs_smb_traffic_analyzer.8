.SH "NAME"
vfs_smb_traffic_analyzer - log Samba VFS read and write operations through a socket to a helper application
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 1
vfs objects = smb_traffic_analyzer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This VFS module is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\.
.PP
The
vfs_smb_traffic_analyzer
VFS module logs client write and read operations on a Samba server and sends this data over a socket to a helper program, which feeds a SQL database\. More information on the helper programs can be obtained from the homepage of the project at: http://holger123\.wordpress\.com/smb\-traffic\-analyzer/
.PP
vfs_smb_traffic_analyzer
currently is aware of the following VFS operations:
.IP "" 4
write
.IP "" 4
pwrite
.IP "" 4
read
.IP "" 4
pread
.PP
vfs_smb_traffic_analyzer
sends the following data in a fixed format seperated by a comma through either an internet or a unix domain socket:

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
smb_traffic_analyzer:mode = STRING
.RS 4
If STRING matches to "unix_domain_socket", the module will use a unix domain socket located at /var/tmp/stadsocket, if STRING contains an different string or is not defined, the module will use an internet domain socket for data transfer\.
.RE
.PP
smb_traffic_analyzer:host = STRING
.RS 4
The module will send the data to the system named with the hostname STRING\.
.RE
.PP
smb_traffic_analyzer:port = STRING
.RS 4
The module will send the data using the TCP port given in STRING\.
.RE
.PP
smb_traffic_analyzer:anonymize_prefix = STRING
.RS 4
The module will replace the user names with a prefix given by STRING and a simple hash number\.
