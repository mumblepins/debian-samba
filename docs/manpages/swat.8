.SH "NAME"
swat - Samba Web Administration Tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 1
swat [\-s\ <smb\ config\ file>] [\-a] [\-P]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\.
.PP
swat
allows a Samba administrator to configure the complex
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
file via a Web browser\. In addition, a
swat
configuration page has help links to all the configurable options in the
\fIsmb\.conf\fR
file allowing an administrator to easily look up the effects of any change\.
.PP
swat
is run from
inetd
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-s smb configuration file
.RS 4
The default configuration file path is determined at compile time\. The file specified contains the configuration details required by the
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
server\. This is the file that
swat
will modify\. The information in this file includes server\-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\. See
\fIsmb\.conf\fR
for more information\.
.RE
.PP
\-a
.RS 4
This option disables authentication and places
swat
in demo mode\. In that mode anyone will be able to modify the
\fIsmb\.conf\fR
file\.
.sp
\fIWARNING: Do NOT enable this option on a production server\. \fR
.RE
.PP
\-P
.RS 4
This option restricts read\-only users to the password management page\.
swat
can then be used to change user passwords without users seeing the "View" and "Status" menu buttons\.
.RE
.PP
\-d|\-\-debuglevel=level
.RS 4
\fIlevel\fR
is an integer from 0 to 10\. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 0\.
.sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day\-to\-day running \- it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\.
.sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
\fIlog level\fR
parameter in the
\fIsmb\.conf\fR
file\.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Prints the program version number\.
.RE
.PP
\-s <configuration file>
.RS 4
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\. The information in this file includes server\-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\. See
\fIsmb\.conf\fR
for more information\. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\.
.RE
.PP
\-l|\-\-log\-basename=logdirectory
.RS 4
Base directory name for log/debug files\. The extension
\fB"\.progname"\fR
will be appended (e\.g\. log\.smbclient, log\.smbd, etc\.\.\.)\. The log file is never removed by the client\.
.RE
.PP
\-h|\-\-help
.RS 4
Print a summary of command line options\.
.RE
.SH "LAUNCHING"
.PP
To launch SWAT just run your favorite web browser and point it at "http://localhost:901/"\.
.PP
Note that you can attach to SWAT from any IP connected machine but connecting from a remote machine leaves your connection open to password sniffing as passwords will be sent in the clear over the wire\.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
\fI/etc/inetd\.conf\fR
.RS 4
This file must contain suitable startup information for the meta\-daemon\.
.RE
.PP
\fI/etc/services\fR
.RS 4
This file must contain a mapping of service name (e\.g\., swat) to service port (e\.g\., 901) and protocol type (e\.g\., tcp)\.
.RE
.PP
\fI/etc/samba/smb.conf\fR
.RS 4
This is the default location of the
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
server configuration file that swat edits. This file describes all the services the server is to make available to clients.
.RE
.SH "WARNINGS"
.PP
swat
will rewrite your
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
file\. It will rearrange the entries and delete all comments,
\fIinclude=\fR
and
\fIcopy= \fR
options\. If you have a carefully crafted
\fI smb\.conf\fR
then back it up or don\'t use swat!
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite\.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
inetd(5),
\fBsmbd\fR(8),
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp\.icce\.rug\.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\.0 release by Jeremy Allison\. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\.2 was done by Gerald Carter\. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\.2 for Samba 3\.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\.
