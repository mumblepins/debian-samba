smbfs (2:3.4.5~dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * As of this version, the mount.cifs binary is no longer setuid.
    Upstream has always been increasingly unsupportive of this
    configuration over time. For instance, in bugs like
    https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6853, it is clearly
    mentioned that having it setuid root is discouraged.
