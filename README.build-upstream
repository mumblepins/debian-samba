Building Samba Packages for Debian GNU/Linux
--------------------------------------------

If you want to build Samba packages for Debian and you just want to use
upstream sources, i.e. you don't want to wait for us to put official
packages out, or you want packages for a Debian version for which we
don't provide deb's, or you don't want to use official packages, or
you want to add --this-cool-switch to configure, or whatever, follow
these instructions:

0) Make sure you have the following packages installed:
  debhelper
  libpam0g-dev
  libreadline4-dev
  libcupsys2-dev
  + the minimum Debian development stuff (dpkg-dev, libc6-dev, etc.)
  Note: the libcupsys2-dev is not available in Debian Potato. That's
    fine; the configure script won't detect CUPS support and the
    resulting binaries won't support CUPS.   
1) cd samba[-<version>]
2) cp -a packaging/Debian/debian/ debian
  It's important that you copy instead of symlink because the build
  tools in Potato have a problem that prevents the build to work with
  a symlink.
3) dch -i (this is completely optional - only do it if you understand
   Debian version numbers! Don't complain later if you can't upgrade
   to official versions of the Samba packages for Debian.)
  - Edit the changelog and make sure the version is right. For example,
  for Samba 2.2.4, the version number should something like 2.2.4-0.1
  (use a number less than 1 like 0.1, 0.2, etc. so there is no conflict
  with future upgrades to the official Debian packages.)
4) Run 'debian/rules binary'.
  - It is better that you prefix the above command with 'fakeroot'.
    If you have problems you might try building as root.
5) That's it. Your new packages should be in ../. Install with dpkg.

Please e-mail samba@packages.debian.org with comments, question or
suggestions. Please talk to us and not to the Samba Team. They have
better things to do and know nothing about the Debian packaging system.
