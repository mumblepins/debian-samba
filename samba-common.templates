Template: samba-common/dhcp
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Modify smb.conf to use WINS settings from DHCP?
 If your computer gets IP address information from a DHCP server on the
 network, the DHCP server may also provide information about WINS servers
 ("NetBIOS name servers") present on the network.  This requires a
 change to your smb.conf file so that DHCP-provided WINS settings will
 automatically be read from /etc/samba/dhcp.conf.
 .
 The dhcp3-client package must be installed to take advantage of this
 feature.

Template: samba-common/do_debconf
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Configure smb.conf automatically?
 The rest of the configuration of Samba deals with questions that
 affect parameters in /etc/samba/smb.conf, which is the file used to
 configure the Samba programs (nmbd and smbd). Your current smb.conf
 contains an 'include' line or an option that spans multiple lines,
 which could confuse the automated configuration process and require
 you to edit your smb.conf by hand to get it working again.
 .
 If you do not choose this option, you will have to handle
 any configuration changes yourself, and will not be able to take
 advantage of periodic configuration enhancements.

Template: samba-common/workgroup
Type: string
_Description: Workgroup/Domain Name:
 Please specify the workgroup you want this server to appear to be in
 when queried by clients. Note that this parameter also controls the
 domain name used with the security=domain setting.

Template: samba-common/encrypt_passwords
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Use password encryption?
 All recent Windows clients communicate with SMB servers using encrypted
 passwords. If you want to use clear text passwords you will need to change
 a parameter in your Windows registry. 
 .
 Enabling this option is highly recommended. If you do, make sure you
 have a valid /etc/samba/smbpasswd file and that you set passwords in
 there for each user using the smbpasswd command.
